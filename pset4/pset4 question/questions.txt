    GIF 256 colors (8 bit color palette)
    JPEG 16.7 million colors
    BMP 16.7 million colors if 24-bits can be more or less
    PNG 8 bit but can extend to 24-bits thus 16.7 milloion

1.  PNG files do not support animation 
    GIF is widely used in animtion
    JPEG does not support animation
    BMP does not look like supporting animation
    
2.  Lossy and Lossless compression are the term describe
    wether or not all original date can be recoverd when uncompress
    the compressed file.
    
3.  Jpeg

4.  What Happens if FAT is deleted:
    FAT stand for File Allocation Table. Information in the adress get deleted,
    however actual file (data) is still in hard drie.
    
5.  What can you do to ensure that file cannot be recovered after delete.
    Overwrite it on the disc with 0s
    Can be doen by using secure delete option

6.  what is stdinr.h?
    It shalll 
    declre sets of interger type having specified width
    and shall define corresponding set of macros.
    it shall also difine macro that specify limit of interger types
    corresponding to types defined in other standard headers
    
7.  What is the point of using unit8_t, unit32_t, int_32t, unit16_t?
    c pogramme has very loose definition on basic interger data types.
    they can guranteed some range of values, but any paticular platfor 
    might be larger than that so. these 4 (unit8_t, unit32_t, int_32t, unit16_t)
    can define the size on the programme. 


8.  how many bytes each

    as defined 
    typedef uint8_t  BYTE;
    typedef uint32_t DWORD;
    typedef int32_t  LONG;
    typedef uint16_t WORD;
    
    so (because 1 byte is 8 bits)
    uint8_t  BYTE;1
    uint32_t DWORD;4
    int32_t  LONG; 4
    uint16_t WORD; 2

9.  in ASCII - "B" "M"
    in hexadecimal - 0x42 0x4D
    
10. bfsize - The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file
    btsize - The number of bytes required by the structure

11. What is biHeight negative
    If biHeight is possitive, it's bottom up from DIC with 
    the origin at lower left corner.
    if biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top down DIB 
    with the origin at the upper left corner
12. biBItcount

13. if it cannot find the file

14. why third arggument to fread is always 1 in our code?
    it specifys how many elements you want to read, we always read a struct thus we onnly need 1.

15. 3

16. it moves to a specific location in a file

17. current position of file pointer
